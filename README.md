# Discord Bot Setup Guide

Welcome to the Discord bot repository! This guide will walk you through setting up and running the bot.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or newer recommended)
- A Discord bot token (from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- Access to the bot's `my_config.json` configuration file

To set up and run the bot from your repository, follow these instructions:

### 1. Download the Code
To download the full code:
- Click on the "Code" button in the repository on GitHub.
- Choose **Download ZIP** to download all the files as a ZIP.
- Unzip the downloaded file to a location on your computer.

### 2. Install Dependencies
- Open a terminal or command prompt in the folder where you've extracted the bot files.
- Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.

### 3. Configure the Bot
- Open the `config.json` file and add your **token**, **clientId**, and **guildId** values.
  
### 4. Start the Bot
You have a `start.bat` file for easy startup. To launch the bot:
- Simply double-click the `start.bat` file, which will automatically start the bot.
